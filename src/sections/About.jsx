            At Pitch, our passion for glamping was borne out of our love of
            camping, music festivals, and exploring the British countryside. We
            want everyone to enjoy the outdoors as much as we do, which is why
            we provide camping that appeals to all â€“ glamping that is
            comfortable, spacious, luxurious, and effortless.
